    <h1>Custom Material (Alpha)</h1>
<br \>
<br \>
A very basic example of a custom Material. They can be used to manipulate shader code.<br \>
<br \>
This particular custom Material uses an Autoparameter for timing and the sin function to calculate its opacity, resulting in a fading effect<br \>
<br \>
Later custom material templates will be able to create custom paramters, textures, shaders, etc.. and will allow for a wide variety of materials to be created.
Custom Lighting will later also be possible using Light Materials. Altough I would recommend changing the HLMS code directly for advanced lighting techniques.
