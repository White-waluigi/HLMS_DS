    <h1>Soft Transparency (Alpha)</h1>
<br \>
<br \>
Transparency is realised by dithering, which means just rejecting every second pixel for 0.5% opacity, every 3rd for 0.333%, etc.. 
<br \>
<br \>
its not the optimal solution and can lead to ugly results, but is still somewhat usefull for large objects, fading in distant obects coming closer, teleport effects and perhaps holorgrams.
<br \>
<br \>
But generally its better to use forwarded objects for alpha blended transparency.
